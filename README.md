# SyntaxFX

**NOTE: This software is in its infancy and isn't even beta quality yet. Use at your own risk.**


SyntaxFX is a syntax highlighting framework written in JavaFX using the RichTextFX library that allows developers to 
implement syntax highlighting capabilities into their applications in a native fashion (no more embedding CodeMirror into
a WebView). Out of the box, it supports syntax highlighting for the following languages:

* Java
* Python
* C
* C++

Support for additional languages can be easily added using tools such as JFlex.

For a greater explanation of SyntaxFX and how it works, please [see the wiki](https://github.com/jdugan6240/SyntaxFX/wiki).
